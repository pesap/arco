# Arco Documentation

Arco is an optimization library for linear and mixed-integer programming on
constrained hardware. It ships as a Python package backed by a Rust core, with
the HiGHS solver embedded so there is nothing extra to install. If your problem
fits in memory, arco will solve it; the library is designed to be direct about
resource limits rather than silently degrading.

## Quickstart

```python doctest
>>> import arco
>>> model = arco.Model()
>>> x = model.add_variable(bounds=arco.Bounds(lower=0.0, upper=float("inf")), name="x")
>>> y = model.add_variable(bounds=arco.Bounds(lower=0.0, upper=float("inf")), name="y")
>>> model.add_constraint(x + y >= 10.0, name="demand")
Constraint('demand', Bounds(10, inf))
>>> model.minimize(3.0 * x + 2.0 * y)
>>> solution = model.solve(log_to_console=False)
>>> solution.is_optimal()
True
>>> round(solution.objective_value, 6)
20.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> Arco embeds the HiGHS solver. No external solver installation is needed.
