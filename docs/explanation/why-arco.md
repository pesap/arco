# Why Arco

Arco stands for **Assembled Resource-Constrained Optimization**.
The name reflects two design choices:

- Assembled: the API direction borrows and combines ideas from multiple
  optimization ecosystems.
- Resource-Constrained Optimization: memory behavior is treated as a
  first-class product requirement.

This page explains why another optimization library exists, what problems it
solves that existing tools do not, and the design philosophy that guides its
development.

## Memory as a first-class constraint

(Planned.)

## Comparison with existing tools

(Planned.)
