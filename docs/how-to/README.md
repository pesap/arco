# How-to Guides

Task-oriented recipes for common operations. Each guide gets straight to the
point with self-contained examples you can copy and run.

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Building Optimization Models](building-optimization-models.md) | Variables, constraints, objectives, and solving in recipe form |
| [Define Block Schemas](block-schemas.md) | Define typed block inputs/outputs with dataclass or pydantic models |
| [Numpy Integration](numpy-integration.md) | Array arithmetic, element-wise bounds, indexing, and reduction operators |
| [Configure Solver](configure-solver.md) | Solver objects, settings, and reusable configurations |
| [Debug Infeasibility](debug-infeasibility.md) | Use slacks and elastic constraints to diagnose infeasible models |
| [Inspect a Model](inspect-model.md) | Examine model structure with snapshots before and after solving |
| [Handle Errors](handle-errors.md) | Catch model-building exceptions and check solver outcomes |
| [Enable Logging](enable-logging.md) | Configure Rust-side tracing and solver output |
